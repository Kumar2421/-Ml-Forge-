# ML FORGE  
### Desktop-first Vision AI IDE for reproducible, local ML workflows

**ML FORGE** is a desktop-first IDE for building, training, evaluating, and deploying **Vision AI models locally** — without cloud lock-in, fragile notebooks, or silent failures.

It replaces ad-hoc scripts, Colab workflows, and brittle pipelines with a **deterministic, end-to-end Vision AI workflow** designed for real-world deployment.

## 🚀 What problem ML FORGE solves

Most Vision AI teams struggle with:
- Fragile notebooks and scripts
- Non-reproducible training runs
- Hidden configuration drift
- Cloud GPU cost & data privacy risk
- Painful transition from experiment → production

**ML FORGE fixes this by design.**

- Every dataset, config, run, metric, and export is explicit
- Training is deterministic and reproducible
- Everything runs locally or on your own infrastructure
- No hidden state. No silent failures.

## 🧠 Who ML FORGE is for

✅ ML engineers & computer vision developers  
✅ Teams building YOLO, detection, OCR, face recognition  
✅ Local / on-prem / edge deployments  
✅ Teams that care about reproducibility and auditability  

❌ Not for large-scale cloud-only experimentation  
❌ Not a hosted AutoML SaaS  
❌ Not a notebook replacement — it’s a workflow IDE

**ML FORGE provides a complete Vision AI lifecycle:**

1. Dataset management (image & video)
2. Annotation with review & history
3. Deterministic training & evaluation
4. Metrics, benchmarks, and comparisons
5. Production-ready exports (ONNX, TensorRT, etc.)
6. Local inference & deployment validation

All inside **one desktop application**.

## 🔑 Core principles

- **Local-first by default**  
  Your data never leaves your machine unless you decide.

- **Deterministic & reproducible**  
  Same inputs → same outputs. Every time.

- **Explicit over magic**  
  No hidden configs, no silent preprocessing, no mystery runs.

- **Production-oriented**  
  Built for models that must ship and stay reliable.
